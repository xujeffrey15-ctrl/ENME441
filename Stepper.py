# stepper_with_shifter.py
#
# Drive a stepper motor through a shift register
#
# Note that the 5V 28BYJ-48 stepper motors can be driven directly
# from the shift register outputs (35mA @ 5V for SN74HC595)
#
# Use Vcc = 5V for both the shift register & motor.
#
# While this code is designed for driving a single motor,
# it can be extended to work with 2+ motors without
# using any additional GPIO pins.
