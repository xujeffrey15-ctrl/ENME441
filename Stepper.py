class Stepper:
    """
    Supports operation of an arbitrary number of stepper motors using
    one or more shift registers.
  
    A class attribute (shifter_outputs) keeps track of all
    shift register output values for all motors.  In addition to
    simplifying sequential control of multiple motors, this schema also
    makes simultaneous operation of multiple motors possible.
   
    Motor instantiation sequence is inverted from the shift register outputs.
    For example, in the case of 2 motors, the 2nd motor must be connected
    with the first set of shift register outputs (Qa-Qd), and the 1st motor
    with the second set of outputs (Qe-Qh). This is because the MSB of
    the register is associated with Qa, and the LSB with Qh (look at the code
    to see why this makes sense).
 
    An instance attribute (shifter_bit_start) tracks the bit position
    in the shift register where the 4 control bits for each motor
    begin.
